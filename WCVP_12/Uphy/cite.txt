Phylogenies built with the U.PhyloMaker R package (Jin and Qian 2022, 2023)
which uses the the GBOTB.extended.WP.tre megatree reported by Jin and Qian (2022).
It included the megatree of seed plants reported by Smith and Brown (2018) and
the pteridophyte part of the megatree reported by Zanne et al. (2014).
